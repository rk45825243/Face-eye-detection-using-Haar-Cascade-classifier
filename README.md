# Face-eye-detection-using-Haar-Cascade-classifier

In this example, I have done face and eye detection. In order to do detection with cascade files, we first need cascade files. These cascade files are available on Github (I have downloadeded these from Github) or we can also create our own cascade files. You can use Google to find various Haar Cascades of things you may want to detect.

For doing face & eye detection we use Python libraries:
1) OpenCV
2) Numpy

Output must be like this
